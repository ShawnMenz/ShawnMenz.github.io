# This is the source code and data of my blog

## Version 2

### 2.3

- Implement Category function, blogs are organized well now.

### 2.2.1

* I migrate the old repo from my git student account to current account. After I graduate, my college will take back the email. In that case, it will be troublesome to maintain the account.

### 2.1

* Hooray! the new version of my homepage!

* It's now powered by [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) and [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) theme.

### 2.2

* Implemented multilingual pages, now my homepage supports both English and Chinese
* Update my CV, thanks for the help of [COE-Departmental Co-op of Northeastern University](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/). The advisors helped me revise my CV.
* Upload some old notes and some new notes that I am currently working on.



## Version 1 (deprecated)

* Inspired by the idea of [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and developed with [bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).

* Backup my notes and blogs locally instead ‎of pushing them to Cloud. I lost part ‎of them because ‎of the server shut-down.
